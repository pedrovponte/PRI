# Search user interfaces

## Questions

### ➡️ Identify and describe user interface techniques and elements that can be used to improve user experience in using search systems.

The elements of a search user interface can be divided into four main categories:
    - **Input:** features that allowthe searcher to express what they are looking for;
    - **Control:** features that help searchers to modify, refine, restrict, or expand their input;
    - **Informational:** features that provide results or information about results;
    - **Personalization:** features that relate specifically to searchers and their previous interactions.

### ➡️ Describe how user interaction innovations and experiments can be evaluated.

There are three main approaches:
- **IR style:** IR systems are traditionally evaluated within a TREC-style environment, based on datasets, specific tasks, and known 'best results' for each task. Given the success of TREC approach, an interactive track was created to take search interaction into account. But success was limited. Simple evaluation measures like precision or recall were not sufficient;
- **Empirical user studies:** focus on how well a system allows searchers to complete a task. Empirical methods are about observing and recording actual user performance (number of searches, number of terms per search, number of results visited, search times, task accuracy). Quantitative methods such as interviews and observations are also possible;
- **Analytical approaches:** typically low-cost or "discount" inspection methods are used to allow evaluators to assess a design and make well informed predictions about SUI. Analytical approaches can leverage the wealth of models and experience previously developed by experts.

### ➡️ What are design principles and heuristics?

It's general users interface guidelines from the HCI and UX communities, like:
- **Visibility:** keep the user informed about what is happening at any given time (eg: keep the current search terms in the query box);
- **Language:** adopt language that the user can understand (instead of 'query' use term 'search');
- **Consistency:** adopt a consistent design that follows the same conventions (eg: highlight spelling errors or mistakes but do not force them on users);
- **Error prevention:** make it hard to do unproductive things (eg: avoid the need to undo actions);
- **Flexibility and efficiency:** provide features and shortcuts for experiences users to be more productive and efficient (eg: let users navigate search results with keyboard shortcuts);
- **Aesthetics and minimalism:** keep design simple and minimalist; make sensible use of white space.
